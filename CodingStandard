Basic rules :)

1. All code in english 
2. Use camel style code writing
 2.1 classes should start with big letter
 2.2 variables and method names with low letter
3. Avoid copy paste, try to reuse code if its from our application or at least rewrite code if you take it from somewhere.
4. All methods should be well documented, but avoid useless comments (l.e. getter and setter)
6. Try to write logs by using qDebug. Make sure that, your debug message containt enaugh information about logged event.
7. Use only qt libs. Our application should be cross platform 
8. Use #IFNDEF FILENAME_H in every header file instead #pragma once

9. Every class should extends QObject (?) //XXX maybe this one isn't necessary
10. No commit, if you can't compile project !
